On Permutations.java everything should work as expected. 

On CoinFlips.java everything works in terms of the commands and stuff, but I couldnt figure out the the histogram completely. As in the = and - on the histogram. The # works as expected though. Formatting works too, I used java.text.DecimalFormat for that
